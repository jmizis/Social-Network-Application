# Social-Network-Application

## Description

In this assignment we had to create a social network application were users can add, and delete friends, create thoughts, update thoughts, and also create reactions, and delete them. I worked mainly in three folders, controllers, models, and routes under api. First I created my new schema under the models, next i created the controllers that will help me navigate throught Insomnia. And finally I created the routes by exporting functions throught the controllers. 




## Video 

For this assignment we had to create a walkthrough video that demonstrated our social network application . I used the app Screencastify to create my video. Below you can watch the video.

## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push.


## Insomnia

For this assignment after creating our code we had to run it in insonmia so we can demonstrate creating, update, and delete users. We also created friends for the users and and thoughts.

## Conclusion

This challenge was tougher than the previous ones but it's a great way to show off our newly learned skills to be able to build the back end of the server with NoSQL. We showed off our skill of creating the models to match up with each api routes. We also showed our skills in created our controllers and being able to use it in Insomnia.
